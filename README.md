# UkudoodSite
This is my first attempt at a portfolio website. The goal is to use react to showcase my work, provide ways to reach me, and get feedback/inquiries.
The pages will include a Home, About Me, Questionaire, Feedback, FAQ, and Projects. While the site is a serious representation of my work, it is also meant to be a representation of me and what I appreciate. For that reason, there will be some unimportant parts that simply bring me joy, including the FAQ and Questionaire pages.

## Home
This will be a simple page for navigating to the main content of the site. It should have an elegant look and features that demonstrate my HTML, CSS, and JaveScript.

## About Me
This will be an informative page that shows my true nature, motivation, and career goals.

## Questionaire
This will be filled with whatever generic, silly questions that I feel like asking the general population.
It could also be a collection of questions aimed at helping me build this or another website.

## Feedback
On this page, I am going to ask people for positive feedback on this website.

## FAQ
Here will be questions that I am generally asked, serious or not, such as "Do you have a twin?"

## Projects
This page will have a completed works section and an "in the shop" section.

### Completed Works
Will be updated frequently, but start with nothing bt the protfolio site itself, considering this is my first website and the protfolio is for web development.

### In the shop
Will also be updated frequently and will likely jut have links to where the project is being kept, such as gitHub, codepen.io, repl.it, etc.
